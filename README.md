# Instant Bogpill from your terminal.

When you need the quick rundown in an instant but too lazy to google it yourself.

Spread the Bogpill like wildfire and watch the Rothschild plan fall apart!
Ideas for usage: spread it to your friends and family, flood their files with the rundown, greet their login with it... Bogdangrad is the limit.

# Installation:

`
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ClovisIRex/Bogpill/master/install.sh | bash
`

After restaring the shell you will able to get the rundown with the `bog` command (defaults to bash).

for a different shell, zsh for example you can run:

`
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ClovisIRex/Bogpill/master/install.sh | bash -s ~/.zshrc
`

Take the Bogpill.

# Note
The Bogpill is obviously a POSIX shell script. If you use Windows you are basically a Rothschild puppet and do not deserve to take it.
