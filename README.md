# When you need the quick rundown in in instant but too lazy to google it yourself.

Spread the Bogpill like wildfire and watch the Rothschild plan fall apart!

## Installation:
`curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ClovisIRex/Bogpill/master/install.sh | bash`
After restaring the shell you will able to get the rundown with the `bog` command (defaults to bash).

for a different shell, zsh for example you can run:
`curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ClovisIRex/Bogpill/master/install.sh | bash -s ~/.zshrc`

Take the bogpill.

# Note
The bogpill is obviously a POSIX shell script. If you use Windows you are basically a Rothschild puppet and do not deserve to take it.
