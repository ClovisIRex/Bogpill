When you need the quick rundown in in instant but too lazy to google it yourself.

Spread the Bogpill like wildfire and watch the Rothschild plan fall apart!

Installation:

run install.sh with root privileges, edit it to change default values. After restaring the shell you will able to get the rundown with the `bog` command.

Take the bogpill.

The bogpill is obviously a POSIX shell script. If you use Windows you are basically a Rothschild puppet and do not deserve to take it.
